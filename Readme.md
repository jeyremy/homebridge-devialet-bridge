  host is meant to specify the Ip adress of your dialog",

  ```
"accessories": [
     {
       "accessory":      "devialet-bridge",
       "name":           "Phantom Living Room",
       "host":           "192.168.1.15"
       "maxVolume":      50

# Notes

  - Accessory : must always be devialet-bridge
  - Name :  any name you want to
  - host : must be the ip adress of your Phantom Bridge (static ip, or force by router)
  - maxVolume : number between 1 to 100 but please keep in mind that 100 is realy loud an siri can misunderstand something 
  
 ` If you are interested in setting the volume of your Phantom(s) with Siri, Only remember to not tell Siri "Set the light in the Living room to 100 %" ;)

 `` We also suggest, in homekit, to put your Devialet Light switch in a different Room in order to not have bad surprise setting something like "Turn on all light in the Living Room" :)
